❓ Problem Statement
👋 Gesture Recognition

You are working as a data scientist at a leading electronics company, ‘SG Electrics' which manufactures state of the art Smart Televisions. As an addition to the smart features of the televisions, you are given the responsibility to develop a model that can recognise 5 different gestures listed below which will help the customers in navigating through the SMART TV without using the remote.

In this project, we are going to build a model that will be able to predict the 5 gestures correctly.

For the application of gesture recognition while watching a movie, the following gestures have been selected with their functionality as described:

Thumbs Up 👍: Increase the volume

Thumbs Down 👎: Lower the volume

Stop ✋: Pause the movie

Left Swipe : Fast Forward 10 seconds

Right Swipe: Fast Backward 10 seconds
